# Active Password Manager (active_pwm)
An active password manager as a web-app deployed behind a Tailscale tailnet.

The main idea is the feature that the password manager will be able to actively change the passwords of the accounts that are stored in it. This is a feature that is not present in most password managers, and it is a feature that is very useful for security reasons.

When a password is set to expire, it will be changed automatically by the password manager. This is a feature that is very useful for security reasons, as it will prevent the account from being compromised, even for websites which you forgot you had an account for.
